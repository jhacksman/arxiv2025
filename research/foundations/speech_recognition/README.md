- **Authors**: Amodei et al. (Baidu)
- **arXiv**: [1512.02595](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595)
- **Category**: Speech Recognition, Deep Learning
- **Summary**: Presents a deep learning system for automatic speech recognition, improving on the original Deep Speech with a deeper LSTM-based acoustic model.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - End-to-end speech recognition
  - Multi-language support (English and Mandarin)
  - Scale-up to thousands of hours of training data
  - Industrial-scale deployment considerations

## Impact
This work demonstrated the scalability of end-to-end deep learning approaches for speech recognition across multiple languages.
