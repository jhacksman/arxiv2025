## Summary
This paper describes GPT-4o, an autoregressive omni model that processes and generates text, audio, image, and video. The system card provides detailed information about the model's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations.

## Key Contributions
- End-to-end training across text, vision, and audio modalities
- Fast response times (232-320ms)
- Improved performance on non-English languages
- Comprehensive safety evaluations and alignment measures
